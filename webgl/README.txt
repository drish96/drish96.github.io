HW5: OpenGL ES
Drishan Sarkar

Draws a spider with lighting in WebGL.
Control the model with your fingers or mouse. 
Use the scroll wheel or hold shift to zoom in.

Open hw5.html and view in a web browser.

Time this took: 2h
Note: I spent ~6h trying to build an iOS app with OpenGL ES 3 but was unsuccessful in debugging the shader programs and could not get lighting to work.
